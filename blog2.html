        <h2>History of Super Computers in India</h2>
        <p>
            It all began in 1980 when United States of America stopped the export of supercomputing to India.
            They feared that India might use those in developing missiles, warplanes rather than weather forecasting which was the application that we intended to use for.
            Little did they know about India's true potential.
            <h2>Establishing C-DAC</h2> 
            Facing the current problem and also in a need of having a supercomputer, India set up Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) in March 1988 with a goal to develop a indigenous supercomputer to meet the needs and requirements to solve complex computational problems.
            The then Prime Minister of India, Rajeev Gandhi established C-DAC as a scientific society.
            
            They appointed Vijay Pandurang Bhatkar as the project chief to build something he has never seen it in his life all too in a double quick time.
            Within three years of short time span, the thing just happened. C-DAC finally completed its work well within the deadline with componenets thatcould be bought off the shelved in 1991, India had its first supercomputer: PARAM 8000.
<h2>Development of C-DAC</h2>
            It was for the first time that a developing country like India pulled off such a feat in Adavnced Computer Development.
            Initially everybody had different mostly negative opinions about the capabililties of PARAM 8000 because the World could not belive that a country like India can pull this really off.
            But when Mr. Bhatkar decided to take the PARAM prototype to a major international conference and exhibition of supercomputers, it was only demonstrated but also benchmarked as a supercomputer.
            An american newspaper even published a article with headline 'Denied SuperComputer!! Angry India does it'. 
              It would be the fastest computer at that time with a benchmarked at 5 GFlops.
              Also it costed less than the fraction of the cost as Cray did and performed just as well.
              <h2>America has competition</h2>
              The US company which made the supercomputer had to slash its prices of its supercomputer fearing they would lose the market.
              PARAM 8000 also set platform for a whole new series of high performance paralleld computers called the PARAM series.
              installed at IIT Guwahati, PARAM Ishan can be used in the application areas like computational chemistry, 
              computational fluid dynamics, computational electromagnetic, civil engineering structures and many more applications.
              
              However, while showing great promise in the field of supercomputing, itâ€™s obvious that India needs to do better and I am sure it will.
